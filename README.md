# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This is my first encounter with React-Native.
The project I chose to to is a straight forward quote - page. That fetches random quotes through api.

## The problem

It was challenging to learn a new "language", to display information from previous knowledge. But with patience and research I got a functional app, that looks good and works, with a completely new typescript, for me. It feels great to manage that.
